Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):

    # Check if the discount percentage is 20% or higher

    if discount_percent >= 20:

        # Calculate the discount amount

        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)

        # Calculate the final price after discount

        final_price = price - discount_amount

        return final_price

    else:

        # If the discount is less than 20%, return the original price

        return price


# Example usage:

original_price = 100

discount_percent = 25

final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percent)

print(f"The final price after applying the discount is: ${final_price:.2f}")
